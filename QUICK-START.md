## Remember

**The app is a tool to help YOU make better decisions.**

It doesn't tell you what to do. It shows you the numbers so you can decide:
- What crops to plant
- Where to plant them
- How much to spend
- When to sell
- What to change

**Good farming = Good records + Good decisions**

Start simple. Add one field. Record your costs. See what happens. Learn and improve!
